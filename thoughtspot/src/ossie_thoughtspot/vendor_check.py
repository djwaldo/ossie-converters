"""The THOUGHTSPOT vendor validator for apache/ossie#697's hook.

`validate.py --vendor THOUGHTSPOT` decodes each THOUGHTSPOT
`custom_extensions` entry and hands the decoded value here, one object at a
time. This module answers one question only -- *is our own payload
well-formed* -- which is the scope the dev@ thread settled on ("own payload
plus own dialect"), narrowed further to the payload for this first checker.

Three deliberate boundaries:

* **It reports, it does not raise.** `stash.read_stash` is the other reader of
  the same payload and it raises, correctly: it runs at the start of a
  conversion that cannot proceed on a payload it cannot trust. A validator is
  the opposite job -- name everything wrong with the document in one pass -- so
  the two readers answer the same questions and end differently. The duplication
  is one `_v` comparison and one scan; sharing the *code* would mean sharing the
  control flow, which is the part that has to differ.
* **It does not name the object.** The hook prefixes every message with the
  vendor and the site (`[Vendor THOUGHTSPOT] Field 'orders.amount' in model
  'sales': ...`), so a message that repeated the name would print it twice.
* **No witness check yet.** The stale-stash check this converter most wants
  needs two things the hook does not have today: the Ossie object the entry
  sits on (every witness is a comparison *against* that object), and a severity
  that does not fail the file (a stale stash is a warning -- the document is
  valid Ossie, our copy of part of it is out of date). Both are promised as a
  follow-up to #697; this checker stays inside what the hook can express.
